# Integer MobileNet Image Classifier with SvelteKit

## About this project

This project demonstrates an image classifier utilizing Integer MobileNet from TensorFlow.js within a SvelteKit framework. Users can download an image, and the application displays the image alongside three predicted classifications. This is a simple project and will evolve throughout my machine learning journey.

**Key Features:**

- Leverages efficient Integer MobileNet model for on-device image classification.
- User-friendly interface for image download and prediction display.
- SvelteKit framework for smooth performance and interactivity.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Estelle-K/ml-vision.git
