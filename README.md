# Building an Image Recognition Website with SvelteKit and TensorFlow.js

## About this project

This project presents an image classifier using MobileNet from TensorFlow.js within a SvelteKit framework. Users can uplod an image, and the application displays the image alongside three predicted classifications. This is a simple project and will evolve throughout my machine learning journey.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Estelle-K/ml-vision.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev -- --open
    ```

4. Access the app: Open <http://localhost:5173/> in your browser.

**Usage:**

1. Click the "Select an image to classify" button and select an image file.
2. The image will be uploaded and displayed.
3. The application will process the image using MobileNet and display three predicted classifications.

**Additional Information:**

- Stay informed about future developments by following the project on GitHub.
